# PIPEX
| 42 Project| Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <a href=""> <img src="https://github.com/0bvim/42-project-badges/blob/main/badges/pipexe.png?raw=true" /></a> | This project implements the working of a well-known UNIX mechanism: the pipe. A pipe allows connecting the output of one command directly to the input of another, thus making data processing more efficient.|

## Mandatory implementation
Your program should be executed as follows: ``./pipex file1 command1 command2 file2``


Running the pipex program should do the same as the following command: ``< file1 command1 | command2 > file2``

## Bonus implementation
Your program should be executed as follows: ``./pipex file1 command1 command2 ... commandn file2``


Running the pipex program should do the same as the following command: ``< file1 command1 | command2 | ... | commandn > file2``
